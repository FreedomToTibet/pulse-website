## Welcome to our small website of sports heart rate monitors store.

### Here there are:
- modal windows
- forms
- slider
- tabs
- animations
- Google maps
- email validation
- phone number validation
- website progress line

### Technologies used in development:

- Gulp
- SCSS
- jQuery
- Native JS
- libraries (wow, slick carousel, prognroll)
- input masks and input validation
- fontawesome
- PHP mailer
and moreâ€¦

P.S. You need to use a local server for the forms to work properly. And in the smart.php file, you need to add your smtp server data and your email.
