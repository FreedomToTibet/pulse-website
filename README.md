## Welcome to our small website of sports heart rate monitors store.

### Here there are:
- moduls windows
- forms
- slider
- tabs
- animations
- Google map

### Technologies used in development:

- Gulp
- SCSS
- jQuery
- Nativ JS
- libraries (wow, slick carousel, prognroll)
- input masks and input validation

- PHP mailer
and moreâ€¦

P.S. You need to use a local server for the forms to work properly. And in the smart.php file, you need to add your smtp server data and your email.
